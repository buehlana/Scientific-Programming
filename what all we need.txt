DONE 1. Collection of real-world data  
📌 Use yfinance (a Python wrapper around Yahoo Finance API) to get historical stock data.

2. Data preparation
🔍 Use pandas for cleaning and processing.
🧹 Apply regular expressions if you extract extra info (e.g., from news headlines or symbols).

3. Python data structures
Use:
lists to hold stock symbols
dicts to store stock-related info
sets if needed to find unique items
tuples for time-based records
pandas.DataFrame for structured analysis

4. Conditional & loop control
Use if, for, and while for:
Filtering data
Iterating over stock lists or dates

5. Programming paradigm
Use functions (procedural) or define classes for Stock/Strategy (OOP)

6. Visualizations
Use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly to:
Compare profits across days
Show opening vs. closing prices
Highlight which strategy performed better

7. Statistical analysis
Calculate:
Daily profit for each strategy
Use scipy.stats.ttest_rel or pearsonr for correlation or comparison
Include p-value in the result

8. Data/code publishing
📦 Use .gitignore to exclude large datasets
📤 Push project to GitHub with a README.md
Additional Requirements

Extra points: 
(2) Web Scraper / Web API
✅ Use yfinance (counts as API)
Optional: Use requests + BeautifulSoup to scrape news headlines for sentiment

(3) Use of a database
Store stock data and profit calculations in SQLite
Use sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy in Python
Perform queries like:
Average profit by strategy
Days where one strategy outperforms the other

(4) Use of LLM
Use OpenAI's API or transformers for:
Summarizing financial news
Detecting trends in stock news
Suggesting trading strategy based on text data

(5) Simple web app
Use Streamlit or Flask to:
Display a dashboard with:
Stock selector
Date range
Charts of profits
Statistical summary

(6) GitHub repository
Create a clean README.md
Add a .gitignore
Structure:
/project-folder
  ├── data/              # empty or .gitignored
  ├── app/               # web app code

Project Development Steps

 🔹 Phase 1: Planning
 Choose a few stocks (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
 Define time period (e.g., last 6 months)
 🔹 Phase 2: Data Collection
 Use yfinance to download historical data (including open & close)
 Store data in SQLite
🔹 Phase 3: Data Processing
 Write functions to calculate:
Strategy A: Buy open, sell close
Strategy B: Buy close, sell next open
 Calculate profit per day
 Store results in DataFrame and database
🔹 Phase 4: Visualization
 Plot daily prices
 Plot profits by strategy
 Show average profit, total return, etc.
🔹 Phase 5: Statistical Analysis
 Use scipy.stats to:
Compare mean profits
Perform t-test
Output p-value
🔹 Phase 6: LLM Integration
 Use OpenAI API (or similar) to:
Summarize financial news
Give a strategy recommendation
(Optional) Extract info from scraped headlines
🔹 Phase 7: Web App
 Build a Streamlit dashboard:
Input: stock ticker, date range
Output: charts, metrics, LLM insight
🔹 Phase 8: Final Touches
 Document code
 Push to GitHub
 Add .gitignore
 Include example outputs in README
